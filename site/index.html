    I have 15 years of experience as a software engineer for companies
    in <strong>Brasil</strong> and, more
    recently, <strong>Australia</strong>. Including remote work, I have also
    worked with clients in the <strong>United States</strong>
    and <strong>Canada</strong>. I am mostly self-taught in my profession.

<p>My motivation is to increase the practicality of formalising abstract ideas
  in <strong>software and digital hardware with static guarantees.</strong>
  I approach problems with innocence and pragmatism.
